= MetaNet Overview =

MetaNet is a full mesh anonymous decentralized chat and file sharing network that utilizes [I2P](https://geti2p.net)
to keep users anonymous. There are no centralized infrastructure or trusted parties (apart from the developers). Network
bootstrap can be done with a static server or via a friend.

The main motivation for creating MetaNet is "IRC sucks".

Pitfalls of IRC:

* Centralization of Infrastructure and Control
* ChanOp / Oper politics caused by Centralization of Control
* Vulnerability to Network attacks caused by Centralization of Infrastructure
* Users Often forced to use persistent identities for authentication, anti-spam and security purposes.
* There is no "one network to rule them all" ( RIP [IRCNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRCnet) )

MetaNet tries to mitigate the Pitfalls of IRC by having every user connect to every other user they wish to chat to.

* No centralization of Infrastructure or Control
* No ChanOp / Oper politics. If you don't like someone don't connect to them.
* Lesser Vulnerability to Network attacks, no central servers to take out to kill the network.
* I2P allows "raw" (unsigned) messages, users can choose to send messages to other users anonymously. This can be toggled as desired.
* [There can only be one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izqeNpod6Mg#t=3m45s) MetaNet unless someone wants to do backwards incompatible changes to the protocol.
